CSV Data
==========

This is a repository of both real and fake data stored in CSV files. 

## Purpose
I had a few projects that dealt with CSV files and I wanted a single
repo where I could keep a common store of CSV files for my test suites.

### Usage
The preferred way to use this repo is to add it as a submodule to an 
existing project.

#### Example
```
git submodule add https://github.com/vincentlaucsb/csv-data.git tests/data
```
